## My process

First I have Designed the form and the home components with HTML5 and CSS and Display them with React Components.
then I have coded the needed methods and functions to make a CRUD Operations to the items with React Hooks such as useContext,useState and useEffect and some higher order JS Methods such as filter,map and forEach.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I have practiced on making CRUD operations then Storing data at The Local Storage and get it.

### Continued development

I wanna continue learning Web Development generally and learn more advanced topics and tools that help me to build more complicated apps such as business apps and more.
but now I'm focusing on learning Front End Development very well.
